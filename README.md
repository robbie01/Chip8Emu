# Chip8Emu

## A simple Chip8Emu written in Standard C++11 and SDL 2

Special thanks to /u/tambry on reddit for helping with a lot of the meta-coding (if that's the right word) :)

TODO:
* enclose cpu stuff in "rc8" namespace
* refactor Chip8Cpu::OnKey to Chip8Cpu::KeyDown
* refactor Chip8Cpu::OffKey to Chip8Cpu::KeyUp
* maybe add some assertions
